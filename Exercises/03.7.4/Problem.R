# Which correlation coefficient should you use to calculate the corre-
# lation between the variables used in the exercise 2? Motivate your
# answer by calculating covariance, and the Pearson and Spearman
#correlation coefficients (and their p-values). Does the Spearman
# correlation coefficient agree with the Pearson correlation calculated
# on log-transformed values?
