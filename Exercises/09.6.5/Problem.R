# Estimate the power law exponent of the CCDF degree distribution
# from the previous exercise. First by a linear regression on the log-
# log plane, then by using the powerlaw package. Do they agree? Is
# this a shifted power law? If so, whatâ€™s k min ? (Hint: powerlaw can
# calculate this for you)
