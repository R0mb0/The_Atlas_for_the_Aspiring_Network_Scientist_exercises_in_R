# Suppose that we are examining a painting and we’re trying to
# date it with the century when it was produced. Find out the Belief
# and Plausibility values for all hypotheses given the following Mass
# estimation (note that, by definition Ω = {XIV, XV, XVI} must have
# Belief and Plausibility equal to one):
#
# Hypothesis  |  Mass    Belief    Plausibility
# ---------------------------------------------
#     ∅       |  0.00
#    XIV      |  0.16 
#    XV       |  0.04

# {XIV, XV}   |  0.34
