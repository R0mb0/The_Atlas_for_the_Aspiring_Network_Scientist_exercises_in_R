# Mr. A considers Ms. B a friend, but she doesnâ€™t like him back. She
# has a reciprocal friendship with both C and D, but only C con-
# siders D a friend. D has also sent friend requests to E, F, G, and
# H but, so far, only G replied. G also has a reciprocal relationship
# with A. Draw the corresponding directed graph.
